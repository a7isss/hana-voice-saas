### 📁 **Files Updated**

#### Core Application Files
- ✅ **`app/main.py`** - Added security, authentication, rate limiting
- ✅ **`app/services.py`** - Enhanced with retry logic and health checks
- ✅ **`render.yaml`** - Updated with security environment variables
- ✅ **`requirements.txt`** - Added PyJWT dependency

#### Deployment Scripts
- ✅ **`scripts/download_models.py`** - Model setup and verification script

### 🔧 **Environment Variables Required**

**CRITICAL - Set these in Render Dashboard:**

```bash
# Security Configuration
VOICE_SERVICE_SECRET=your-secure-admin-secret
VOICE_SERVICE_TOKEN=your-jwt-secret-for-tokens

# Rate Limiting
MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=10
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# Model Configuration
VOSK_MODEL_PATH=/data/models/vosk-model-ar-0.22
TTS_HOME=/data/tts_cache

# Application Settings
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
VOICE_SERVICE_ENV=production
```

### 🌐 **API Endpoints Available**

#### Public Endpoints
- `GET /` - Basic service information
- `GET /health` - Health check with model status

#### Secure Endpoints (Require Authentication)
- `GET /auth/token` - Generate JWT token (admin only)
- `GET /admin/sessions` - Active session monitoring (admin only)
- `GET /admin/health` - Comprehensive health with security metrics (admin only)

#### WebSocket Endpoints
- `ws://` - Basic voice processing (unsecured)
- `ws://secure` - Authenticated voice processing with rate limiting
- `ws://secure/healthcare` - Healthcare questionnaire with full security

### 📊 **Security Features Summary**

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **JWT Authentication** | ✅ | Token-based auth for secure endpoints |
| **Rate Limiting** | ✅ | 60 requests/minute per IP |
| **Session Limits** | ✅ | Max 10 concurrent sessions |
| **Model Health Checks** | ✅ | Automatic model availability monitoring |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ | Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks |
| **Input Validation** | ✅ | Request validation and sanitization |
| **Admin Monitoring** | ✅ | Session and security metrics for admins |

### 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

#### 1. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**
- [ ] Set all required environment variables in Render dashboard
- [ ] Verify persistent disk is configured (5GB for models)
- [ ] Ensure Python 3.11 runtime is selected
- [ ] Confirm Frankfurt region for low latency to Saudi Arabia

#### 2. **Model Setup**
- [ ] Models will be automatically downloaded on first deployment
- [ ] Vosk Arabic model (~1.2GB) will be cached on persistent disk
- [ ] Coqui XTTS model will be cached in TTS_HOME directory
- [ ] Model verification will run automatically

#### 3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
- [ ] Check `/health` endpoint returns "healthy" status
- [ ] Verify models are loaded and responsive
- [ ] Test secure WebSocket endpoints with authentication
- [ ] Confirm rate limiting is working
- [ ] Validate session management

### 🔍 **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

#### Health Check Commands
```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://your-service.render.com/health

# Admin health check (requires authentication)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET" \
     https://your-service.render.com/admin/health

# Active sessions monitoring
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET" \
     https://your-service.render.com/admin/sessions
```

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem: Models fail to load**
- Check persistent disk space (needs 5GB)
- Verify network connectivity for model downloads
- Check Render logs for detailed error messages

**Problem: Authentication fails**
- Verify VOICE_SERVICE_SECRET is set correctly
- Check JWT_SECRET is configured
- Ensure proper token format in requests

**Problem: Rate limiting too restrictive**
- Adjust RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE in environment variables
- Monitor usage patterns and adjust limits accordingly

### 📈 **Performance Considerations**

- **Memory Usage**: ~2-3GB RAM for loaded models
- **Storage**: 5GB persistent disk for models and cache
- **Network**: High bandwidth for audio streaming
- **CPU**: Single core sufficient for basic usage
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limited to 10 for stability

### 🚨 **Critical Security Notes**

1. **Environment Variables**: Set VOICE_SERVICE_SECRET and VOICE_SERVICE_TOKEN in Render dashboard (do NOT commit to code)
2. **CORS Configuration**: Update allowed origins for production domain
3. **Rate Limits**: Monitor and adjust based on actual usage patterns
4. **Session Management**: Implement session cleanup for long-running service
5. **Model Security**: Models are stored on persistent disk, ensure proper access controls

### 📞 **Support & Maintenance**

For ongoing maintenance:
- Monitor `/admin/health` endpoint regularly
- Check Render logs for errors or warnings
- Update models as new versions become available
- Review and adjust rate limits based on usage patterns
- Monitor session counts and performance metrics
