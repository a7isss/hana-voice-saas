- **Phase 2 Planning**: Voice processing and FreePBX integration
- **Security Hardening**: Environment variable protection and API rate limiting

## Current System State

### **API Health Status**: 🟢 ALL HEALTHY
```
GET /api/auth      → ✅ 200 OK (Authentication & database connectivity)
GET /api/voice     → ✅ 200 OK (Voice service availability)
GET /api/data      → ✅ 200 OK (Data export functionality & audio set management)
GET /api/telephony → ✅ 200 OK (Telephony integration readiness)
```

### **Component Separation Clarified**
#### 🎯 **Three Distinct Components**:

1. **🏢 Company Greetings** (Hospital Branding Messages)
   - **Purpose**: Hospital/clinic-specific identification and branding
   - **Storage**: `company_greetings` database table
   - **Example**: "King Faisal Specialist Hospital calling" / "مستشفى الملك فيصل التخصصي يتحدث"
   - **Management**: Audio Conversion page → Company Greetings section
   - **Required**: Must select BEFORE audio set in batch calling

2. **🎵 Audio Set Intro Greetings** (Survey Introduction)
   - **Purpose**: Welcome patients to specific survey types
   - **Storage**: `audio_sets.audioFiles` array with `intro_greeting` ID
   - **Example**: "مرحباً بك في استبيان صحة القلب"
   - **Management**: Auto-generated from JSON template upload
   - **Note**: CAN BE REMOVED from JSON sample template now

3. **📋 Question Templates** (Survey Structure Files)
   - **Purpose**: Raw survey questions configuration
   - **Storage**: User-uploaded JSON files (temporary)
   - **Processing**: Converted to audio sets database records
   - **Example**: testing/samples/audio-set-template.json without intro_greeting
   - **Management**: File upload → Process → Store as audio set

#### **Priority Order in Calls**:
1. **Company Greeting** (Hospital identification) ← Crucial for trust
2. **Audio Set Greeting** (Survey introduction)
3. **Survey Questions** (Patient responses)

#### **Admin Setup Flow**:
1. Create company greetings (optional for testing)
2. Upload JSON templates → Convert to audio sets
3. Select greeting + audio set → Start batch calling

### **Deployment Status**: 🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION
- **Render Configuration**: `render.yaml` properly configured
- **Environment Variables**: Production values set in Render dashboard
- **Build Process**: `npm install && npm run build` successful
- **Health Checks**: All endpoints responding within expected parameters

### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ No errors
- **Build Success**: ✅ Production build passes
- **Linter Status**: Hardened with Next.js ESLint configuration
- **Package Dependencies**: All dependencies installed and compatible

### **Known Issues & Workarounds**
- **Environment Variable Names**: Note - some legacy references use `SUPABASE_URL` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (documented issue resolved in current deployment)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Currently set to placeholder in development, requires production key for full voice functionality
- **FreePBX Integration**: Mock implementation in place, real telephony integration planned for Phase 2

## Team Coordination & Communication

### **Development Team Status**
- **Solo Developer Mode**: Primary developer (Ahmad) managing full-stack development
- **Git Workflow**: Clean commit history, regular synchronization with remote repository
- **Version Control**: Feature branches for development, main branch for stable releases
