### **Core Features Overview**

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Three Core Features**:

1. **ðŸ¤– Agent Configuration** (Script Management System)
   - **Purpose**: Arabic conversation script creation, editing, and management
   - **Storage**: Supabase `agent_scripts` table with Arabic text and metadata
   - **Features**: Full CRUD operations, step-by-step script playback, voice tester integration
   - **Usage**: Create scripts for healthcare inquiries, follow-ups, medical assessments
   - **Management**: `/agent-configuration` page with real-time voice testing

2. **ðŸŽµ Voice Tester** (Interactive Script Testing)
   - **Purpose**: Test Arabic script playback with voice synthesis and recognition
   - **Storage**: Temporary audio files generated by Coqui XTTS models
   - **Features**: Real-time TTS playback, speech-to-text verification, step navigation
   - **Integration**: Connects directly with agent configuration for seamless testing
   - **Management**: `/voice-tester` page with WebSocket audio streaming

3. **ðŸŽ­ Calling Robot** (Production Voice Interface)
   - **Purpose**: Professional Arabic voice calls using Maqsam telephony service
   - **Storage**: Call logs and interaction data in Supabase
   - **Features**: Script playback with memory/context tracking, Maqsam integration
   - **Authentication**: Pre-shared token system for secure telephony access
   - **Management**: `/calling-robot` page with call monitoring and analytics

#### **Voice Processing Architecture**:
- **Speech Recognition**: Vosk model (Arabic `vosk-model-ar-0.22`) - Local processing
- **Text-to-Speech**: Coqui XTTS v2 (Arabic voices) - Local processing
- **Model Storage**: Automatic download and caching in Python service
- **No External APIs**: Complete local processing for cost efficiency

#### **Data Flow**:
1. **Script Creation**: Arabic text â†’ Supabase storage â†’ Voice testing
2. **Call Execution**: Selected script â†’ Maqsam telephony â†’ Voice interaction
3. **Response Processing**: Audio input â†’ Vosk STT â†’ Script logic â†’ Coqui TTS output

### **Deployment Status**: ðŸš€ READY FOR PRODUCTION
- **Render Configuration**: `render.yaml` properly configured
- **Environment Variables**: Production values set in Render dashboard
- **Build Process**: `npm install && npm run build` successful
- **Health Checks**: All endpoints responding within expected parameters

### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **TypeScript Compilation**: âœ… No errors
- **Build Success**: âœ… Production build passes
- **Linter Status**: Hardened with Next.js ESLint configuration
- **Package Dependencies**: All dependencies installed and compatible

### **Known Issues & Workarounds**
- **Model File Management**: Vosk Arabic models need proper storage location configuration
- **Environment Cleanup**: Legacy FreePBX and OpenAI variables need removal from Render services
- **Maqsam Integration**: Pre-shared token validation requires proper TELEPHONY_TOKEN setup

### **Model File Locations** (Critical for Voice Processing)
- **Vosk Arabic STT Model**: Stored in `Python/voice_service/models/vosk-model-ar-0.22/`
- **Coqui XTTS Models**: Auto-downloaded to `Python/voice_service/models/tts/` on startup
- **Production Location**: Models cached in `/data/models/` on Render (persistent disk)
- **Download on Startup**: First request automatically downloads ~100MB of Arabic models

## Team Coordination & Communication

### **Development Team Status**
- **Solo Developer Mode**: Primary developer (Ahmad) managing full-stack development
- **Git Workflow**: Clean commit history, regular synchronization with remote repository
- **Version Control**: Feature branches for development, main branch for stable releases

### **External Dependencies**
- **Supabase Project**: `piyrtitsyhesufkceqyy.supabase.co` - Active and configured
- **Render Account**: Service `hana-voice-saas` and `hana-voice-service` deployed
- **Maqsam Telephony**: Ready for pre-shared token authentication (no API key required)
- **GitHub Repository**: `a7isss/hana-voice-saas` - Public repository for deployment

### **Voice Model Dependencies**
- **Vosk Arabic STT**: Local processing (vosk-model-ar-0.22)
- **Coqui XTTS Arabic**: Local TTS generation (5 Arabic voices available)
- **Model Storage**: Automatic download and caching, no external dependencies

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### **High Priority Risks**
- **Voice Model Download Failures**: Mitigation - Implement model download retry logic and fallbacks
- **Maqsam Telephony Authentication**: Mitigation - Validate pre-shared token setup before production use
- **Supabase Rate Limiting**: Mitigation - Implement connection pooling and request batching

### **Medium Priority Risks**
- **Arabic Language Processing**: Mitigation - Additional testing with native speakers
- **Scalability Performance**: Mitigation - Load testing planned for Phase 2
- **Third-party API Costs**: Mitigation - Usage monitoring and budget controls

## Decision Log

### **Recent Decisions (Last Week)**
1. **Render as Deployment Platform**: Confirmed due to ease of use, strong ecosystem fit, and healthcare SaaS compatibility
2. **Supabase as Primary Database**: Chose for real-time capabilities, built-in security features, and PostgreSQL reliability
3. **Next.js API Routes Pattern**: Adopted for serverless architecture, easy deployment, and TypeScript integration
4. **Multi-tenant API Key Auth**: Implemented for healthcare client isolation and security requirements

### **Pending Decisions**
1. **Voice Processing Fallback Strategy**: Options include Azure Speech Services vs local processing
2. **Real-time Dashboard Implementation**: WebSocket vs polling for call monitoring
3. **Mobile App Development**: React Native vs separate native apps
4. **Analytics Integration**: Custom dashboard vs Power BI embedding

## Work Patterns & Preferences

### **Development Workflow**
- **Time Focus**: Evening/night development sessions (Riyadh timezone)
- **Communication Style**: Direct, technical, solution-oriented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive memory bank system for context preservation
- **Quality Gates**: No deployment without passing all health checks

### **Problem Solving Approach**
- **Systematic Analysis**: Always audit entire technology stack before changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate impact on healthcare production systems
- **Incremental Implementation**: MVP-first approach with phased feature rollout
- **Saudi Context Awareness**: Consider cultural, linguistic, and regulatory factors
