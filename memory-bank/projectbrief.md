# Project Brief: Hana Voice SaaS

## Project Overview

Hana Voice SaaS is a comprehensive healthcare voice automation platform designed specifically for Saudi Arabian healthcare providers. The system automates patient outreach through voice calls, conducts health surveys in Arabic, and provides detailed analytics and reporting capabilities.

## Core Mission

Transform healthcare communication in Saudi Arabia by automating patient outreach, enabling Arabic language surveys, and delivering actionable analytics that improve patient care and operational efficiency.

## Success Criteria

1. **Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed and running on Render platform
2. **API Functionality**: All core APIs (auth, voice, data, telephony) working correctly
3. **Arabic Language Support**: Full RTL text handling and Arabic voice processing
4. **Healthcare Compliance**: Meets Saudi Arabian healthcare data standards
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Built for healthcare provider scale with modern serverless stack

## Key Deliverables

- Working MVP with full API health checks
- Production-ready deployment on Render
- Multi-tenant authentication system
- Voice survey automation foundation
- Excel export functionality with Arabic RTL support
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides

## Scope Boundaries

- Initial MVP focuses on API foundation and deployment readiness
- Voice processing integration with OpenAI (TTS/STT)
- Telephony integration with FreePBX
- Database integration with Supabase PostgreSQL
- Frontend healthcare dashboard (admin interface)

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT for voice processing and analysis
- **Telephony**: FreePBX AMI integration for automated calls
- **Deployment**: Render platform for scalable production hosting
- **Languages**: Arabic (primary), English (secondary)
- **Compliance**: Healthcare data privacy and Saudi regulations

## Project Phases

1. **Phase 1**: MVP Foundation (API health checks, authentication, deployment)
2. **Phase 2**: Voice Processing Integration (OpenAI TTS/STT)
3. **Phase 3**: Telephony Integration (FreePBX automated calling)
4. **Phase 4**: Healthcare Dashboard (admin interface, analytics)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Features (multi-language, real-time monitoring)

## Target Completion

- MVP Deployment: Ready for production (GOLDEN NUGGET achieved)
- Full Healthcare Platform: Q1 2025

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: Saudi Arabian hospitals and clinics
- **Use Cases**: Patient outreach, health survey automation, call analytics
- **Technical Stack Requirements**: Modern web technologies, AI integration, telephony

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Voice service integration with OpenAI (mitigated: fallback handling)
- **Medium Risk**: FreePBX telephony integration (mitigated: modular design)
- **Low Risk**: Frontend development (mitigated: proven Next.js/Tailwind stack)

## Success Metrics

- API health checks: 100% passing
- Deployment success: First-time deploy successful on Render
- Authentication: Working client-based multi-tenancy
- Code Quality: TypeScript compilation without errors
- Documentation: Comprehensive setup and deployment guides
